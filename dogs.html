<li><p>This is Ralph. He was trampled by a horse. Claims he was just trying to make a friend. His human dropped him off to be euthanized, but the vet he was surrendered to adopted him instead. We‚Äôve paid for his medical care and told him to never stop trying to make new friends. 13/10 https://t.co/QUw4iSjNRY</p>

<li><p>This is Toaster. She arrived at the shelter with eye trauma, a broken tooth, and several fractures in her pelvis and hind legs. Our first step is to buy her a mobility cart, then figure out surgery. You can help @15outof10 help her by donating below ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π

<li><p>This is Zipper and Yahtzee. They are almost identical, except Zipper is a little taller and reminds Yahtzee constantly. They walk together, cuddle together, and beg together. They even have @Trupanion together. 13/10 for both #partner https://t.co/lrez0eYjGM</p>
