# Exploring how to build Chrome extensions

First, following the [tutorial](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/), on branch `chrome-tutorial`

Then, started developing an extension to replace news pictures and headlines with WeRateDog pics and tweets from the Twitter API.

To use the Twitter API, a [Bearer Token](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-2-0) is needed. I have not exposed mine, and so I need to add it locally to run. Not yet sure how I might want to handle this if I wanted to make this public

[Rusty Zone](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-h4Q0_5zTX66AxJucRmxRQ) on YouTube has a lot of great resources for building chrome extensions.
